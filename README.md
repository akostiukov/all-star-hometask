For home task was user Rest-Assured library for testing API, cause given application is simple 
and has only GET http methods for use as user. As well it doesn't require any authentificanion(except API key "1").
For "lightweight" projects like CocktailDB it make sanse to use Rest-Assured framework as it has "human readable" syntax and
a lot of verifying functionality "from the box", so anybody can understand how it works and extens API tests by himself.
Also current package include TestNG framework for more flexible test runs and input data sets(Data Provider).
